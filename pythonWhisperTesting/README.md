This is a folder dedicated to any scripts or code I write when testing and using OpenAI's Whisper. 

WOW! I switched from using whisper to faster-whisper. It's astonishingly fast. My new script for faster-whisper has been added. 
  - Faster-whisper works so much better with audio that includes lots of silence, since the base whisper is very hallucination-prone.
